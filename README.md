Hi, I'm Elif
📍 Data Science Grad Student | Aspiring Analyst | Curious Problem Solver  

I'm currently exploring data analysis, visualization, and storytelling using tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. My projects reflect both academic work and real-world interests—especially in areas like public data, consumer behavior, and business analytics.

💻 Current focus:
- Cleaning and analyzing messy real-world datasets  
- Learning APIs and machine learning techniques  
- Applying AI tools to uncover patterns and support decision-making  

🔎 Always open to learning, building, and collaborating.
